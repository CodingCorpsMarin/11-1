Create a new Rails App
>rails new app

Create the db
>rails db:create

Create a model for users
>rails generate model User name:string bio:text age:integer

Check out model, check out migration

Migrate db
> rails db:migrate

Play with our db in the console
>rails c(onsole)

Create an instance of User
>bob = User.new(name: 'Bob', age: 20)

Can fill in bio later
>bob.bio = 'Bob likes turtles'

Save 
>bob.save

Exit console
Go into model page and give User instances a method, for example, they can say how old they are

  def how_old
    'I'm ' + self.age.to_s + ' years old!'
  end

Go into console again and call that method
>bob.how_old
