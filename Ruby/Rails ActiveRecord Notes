Competencies

Rails uses generators to do a lot of work, including generating models
The Rails model generator allows you to create model files with different attributes, can always also add more manually
Rails model generator will create a model file AND a migration file
Everything inside the model file will define the user (specific methods, for example)
Migrations hold the information for the attributes of the model
Later, migrations will hold the information for changes to that modelâ€™s base table
