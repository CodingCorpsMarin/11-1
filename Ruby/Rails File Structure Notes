Competencies

All Rails apps have a set structure to follow, this makes it easy for developers to build apps quickly and work in groups efficiently
“Rails new [app]” creates all the files in a default rails app
App folder holds MVC components
Assets folder holds stylesheets and js for frontend functionality
Bin folder holds executables for rake, rails, bundle commands
Config -> Environments holds info on how each environment is set
Database.yml is where you will configure different databases if need be
Routes is where you will handle routing
DB is where you will handle migrations, do not touch schema.rb
Lib folder holds reusable code that aren’t rake tasks that you might want to use
Log folder holds dev logs so you can keep track of what you’ve done/debugging
Public folder is where your error pages go
Test folder holds tests (rspec, anyone?)
Tmp holds temp files such as cached data and sessions
Vendor folder holds assets for third party gems, probably won’t need to touch this at all

Applications
Understand the file structure of a Rails app so you know how and what to tweak things when needed
